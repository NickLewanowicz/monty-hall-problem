# ___Monty Hall Simulator___
The monty hall problem is pulled from a game show. The setup is there is a _CONTESTANT_ and _SHOW HOST_.
There are three doors and behind one of them is a sports car and the other 2 hide goats.
The _SHOW HOST_ knows where the prize is but the _CONTESTANT_ doesnt.
The _CONTESTANT_ picks a single door and in response the _SHOW HOST_ opens one of the doors which hides a goat.
At this point the _CONTESTANT_ is offered the opportunity to switch their selection to the other unopened door.
This simulator shows what the result of switching is vs not switching.

The result is that switching will ~double your odds of winning. Their is a relatively simple proof for this but thats not why this simulator exists.

_How to run:_  
`Install python version 2.X` <- may work on newer version  
`in terminal navigate to the directory with:`  
  ` - test_monty_hall.py`  
  ` - monty_hall_simulator.py`  
`Run command: python test_monty_hall.py`

You will be prompted to input a number of iterations and weather you want to simulate switching your guess and not switching your guess.
